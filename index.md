# Armontae Harris - Applied Computer Science â€“ Portfolio



## Major Projects

- ### CSMA 101 Introduction to Programming - Echo Theohar - Fall 2019
##### In this course we explored computer generated media, using the coding language "P5.js". We coverered essential programming concepts like: variables, inputs, looping, functions, arrays, object based programming, data visualisation, and an introduction into Python and APIs. We ended the semester developing a github site that hosted all of our projects. Mine is still functional! The link is [here!](https://azharris1964.github.io/Harrishosting.github.io/)

- ### CSMA 111 Introduction to Three-Dimensional Worlds - Mark Ericson - Spring 2021
##### The objective of this course was to explore 3-dimensional space using computation. In practice, we used manipulated sphere algorithms to manipulate and distort space. We explored methods of 3-D rendering first in processing, then in Rhino.

  - Round Drawings : We learned about drawing spheres and the fundamentals of drawing using computation in Processing.

  - Round Objects : We built on the drawing techniques we learned earlier to draw our circles as spheres. We learned how to manipulate color and line attributes. Around this time we migrated to Rhino with the Python editor and began making some really complex shapes.

 - Round Worlds : In this final project, we developed a conceptual algorithm that created a shape based on a set of seemingly arbitrary questions. I made my shapes change their forms and color based on questions relating to the user's mood. The shape could also be named, have an animation applied to it, and save itself to a folder as an image and small .mp4. Some of the shapes made by classmates who ran the program are here:
