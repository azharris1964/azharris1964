# Armontae Harris - Applied Computer Science â€“ Portfolio



- ## CSMA 101 Introduction to Programming - Echo Theohar - Fall 2019
#### In this course we developed computer generated media using the coding language "P5.js". We coverered essential programming concepts like: variables, inputs, looping, functions, arrays, object based programming, data visualisation, and an introduction into Python and APIs. We ended the semester developing a github site that hosted all of our projects. Mine is still functional. The link is [here!](https://azharris1964.github.io/Harrishosting.github.io/)

- ## CSMA 111 Introduction to Three-Dimensional Worlds - Mark Ericson - Spring 2021
#### The objective of this course was to explore 3-dimensional space using computation. In practice, we used manipulated sphere algorithms to create unique 3D objects. We explored methods of 3-D rendering first in processing, then in Rhino. For my final project I developed a plugin in Rhino that developed unique objects based on mood that can be named, animated, and saved.

  - Round Drawings
 #### We learned about drawing spheres and the fundamentals of drawing using computation in Processing.

  - Round Objects
 #### We built on the drawing techniques we learned earlier to draw our circles as spheres. We learned how to manipulate color and line attributes. Around this time we migrated to Rhino with the Python editor and began making some really complex shapes.

 - Round Worlds 
 ##### In this final project, we developed a conceptual algorithm that created a shape based on a set of questions. I made my shapes change their forms and color based on questions relating to the user's mood. The shape could also be named, have an animation applied to it, and save itself to a folder as an image and small .mp4. Some of the shapes made by classmates who ran the program are here:

- ## CSMA 112 Interactive Prototyping - Gottfried Haider - Spring 2021
#### In this course I learned got a hands-on introduction into prototype creation and design. We learned practical electronics knowledge along with programming in Python to develop working prototypes. We got to use microcomputers, sensors, fabrication software, LEDs. and more to establish interactions between users and these objects.

- ## CSMA 113 Mixed Reality - Michael Peguero - Spring 2021
#### This class allowed me to expermient with the world of VR and AR in a computational and design framework. This class taught me how to develop VR and AR interactions for tools such as SparkAR, Glitch.io, A-Frame, and finally Unity. We practiced different aspects of computational design and learned the skills to produce media using video processing, motion, and my conceptual aesthetics.

- ## CSMA 212 Media Environments - Ivaylo Getov - Spring 2022
#### In this class I explored the concept of media environments and I created my own using TouchDesigner. This meant projection mapping, room-scaled installations, depth tracking, and other forms of media that interact with both the user and the space. This is accomplished in a program called "TouchDesigner" where modules are put together to project an output with the given variables. This program can handle anything from motion tracking to object instantiation.

  - Texture and Channels Assignment
#### For this assignment I created an abstracted game show in the vain of shows like Squid Game, where the virtual user answers yes or no questions by crossing the halfway point of the marked experience borders.

 - Deep Space Experience Midterm Assignment
#### In this midterm assignment, we developed a spacial installation that uses color, light, and space. The assigment required that we have a clear idea of where this installation would take place and who it is for. We were also tasked with using something other than flat or 2D screens for the bulk of the visual content. My assignment was called the Deep Space Experience and is a full-room installation meant to take place at the California Science Center, specifically, the Stars and Telescopes Exhibit. The format of the visual content is floor projection lights, clear plastic strips suspended from the ceiling, and mirror walls. Free use visuals of space travel simulations are used to immerse user in what should feel like a vaccum in space.

- Gestural Grafitti
#### For my final assignment I am going to use kinect spatial sensors the implement what I refer to as gestural grafitti on what at first glance appears to be a blank wall. Users will use both hands to do actions like draw, erase, change color, and save their image.


- ## CSMA 213 Artificial Intelligence - Nikita Pashenkov - Spring 2022
#### This class has taught me some of the principles and algorithms that govern machine and deep learning. We explored concepts like search algorithms, evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, and model training. We endede the semester exploring generative neural network models on public notebooks in places like google colab and Hugging face. Our final project consisted of us creating our own GAN that gets trained on models to generate an output. My assignment was fed models of Ukiyo-E style portraits and generates an output that resembles that art style with the inputted image.

- ## CSMA 214 Applied Mathematics - Michael Peguero - Spring 2022
#### Taking this course exposed me algorithmic thinking and mathematical logic in the context of computation. We explored the applications of flocking/swarming simulations as well as genetic algorithms that learn from previous inputs. The core concept of this class is deriving an issue and solving it algorithmically. For my fianl assignment I created a Shopping Sjimulation in Unity that combined various algorithms and methods to create an abstracted shopping mall experience.
